				<p> Hi there, I'm Heidi! I’m from Irvine, California, and I’m currently in my 3rd year studying Computer Science at Stanford University. I’m interested in how artificial intelligence and data science can be leveraged in innovative ways for social impact work. This can look like anything from conducting statistical analyses of voter purges or gender bias, to building ML models to make cities more equitable and sustainable. My main fields of interest are NLP/machine learning and data visualization. </p>
				<p> I’m looking for fun and meaningful work for next summer! Please let me know of anything exciting I can work on. </p>

			<h3> Detecting Gender Bias in Physician Comments </h3>
			<p> Developed an analysis to detect gender bias in patient comments about their physicians. Ran a logistic regression on the presence of words associated with compassion, 
			ambition, and attitude on a database of 125,000 comments and quantitative ratings, controlling for possible confounding variablels such as physician speciality, race, and age. </p>
			<p> We discovered that female doctors were consistently described as more compassionate even when accounting for their field, ethnicity, and rank, but that compassion-related terms correlated with higher quantitative ratings. While perhaps unsurprising to the average reader, this has sweeping implications for medical education. A Stanford physician told me recently that if she were to recommend a student as an amazing technical surgeon, but also a “warm” doctor or “good teacher”, that student would almost certainly be rejected. The results of our study, however, quantitatively and definitively show that such qualities, traditionally associated with femininity, actually make for better doctors. We plan to publish our results recommending that medical school educators place more emphasis on compassionate bedside manner. </p>
