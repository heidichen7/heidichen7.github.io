				<p> Hi there, I'm Heidi! I graduated from Stanford in 2020 and I'm currently a Software Engineer at Google. I’m interested in how data and computer science can be leveraged in innovative ways for social impact work. This can look like anything from conducting statistical analyses of voter purges or gender bias, to building ML models to make cities more equitable and sustainable. I'm particularly interested in the domains of geospatial data and urban transit.</p>
				<p> I’m looking for fun and meaningful work, from civic tech to startups!  </p>

			<h1> Projects, Publications, and Work Experience</h1>
			
			<h2> Detecting Gender Bias in Physician Comments - Stanford InfoLab Research </h2>
			<p> Developed an analysis to detect gender bias in patient comments about their physicians. Ran a logistic regression on the presence of words associated with compassion, 
			ambition, and attitude on a database of 125,000 comments and quantitative ratings, controlling for possible confounding variablels such as physician speciality, race, and age. 
			My paper was published to <a href="http://doi.org/10.1089/jwh.2019.8233"> Women's Journal of Health!</a></p>
			
			<h2> Interleaving Deep Dive: Data visualization for Bing Feature Experiments - Microsoft AI + Research Internship </h2>
			<p> Built an end-to-end pipeline for developers at Bing to better understand the results of feature experiments. Developed generalizable scripts to mine data from Microsoft servers, filter significantly moved queries, and parse the ranker data to reveal the original and new rankers for those queries. </p>

			<h2> CS198: Section Leading! </h2>
			<p> I was a section leader (aka, undergrad TA) for CS106A and CS106B, the introductory courses to CS at Stanford. </p>
			
			
			<h1> Other fun things about me </h1>
			
			<p>
			I love dancing, painting, guitar, and being outdoors. You can check out some of my guitar covers and travel watercolors at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/heidi.frets/"> here. </a>
			I've been kayaking throughout Seattle, and recently went to Tomales Bay to kayak in the dark, looking for bioluminescent dinoflagellates (and found some!)
